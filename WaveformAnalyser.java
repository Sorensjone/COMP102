/**
 * This is related to your program from assignment 4 which analysed polution levels
 * However, instead of reading data from the user, it reads the data from
 * a file into an ArrayList, which means that it can analyse the numbers
 * more easily and in more different ways.
 * It can also cope with much larger sets of numbers.
 * The numbers are guaranteed to be integers but the values can be
 *   negative and the signal swings above and below zero.
 *
 * There are 11 methods you are to complete, all focusing on the ArrayList of data.
 * CORE
 *  doRead:              reads numbers into an ArrayList.
 *  doDisplay:           displays the waveform.
 *  doReportDistortion:  prints out the fraction of time the signal is distorted.
 * COMPLETION
 *  doSpread:            displays the spread with two horizontal lines and returns its value.
 *  doDisplayDistortion: shows in red the distorted part of the signal.
 *  doHighlightPeaks:    plots the peaks with small green circles.
 * CHALLENGE
 *  doNormalise:         normalises all the values down so there is no distortion.
 *  upperEnvelope:       displays the upper envelope.
 *  lowerEnvelope:       displays the lower envelope.
 *  doSave:              saves the current waveform values into a file.
 *  select and edit:     let the user select a regions of the waveform with the mouse
 *                       to remove them.  Add a save button to save the edited values.
